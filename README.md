# Dresen

Personal website that can be found at https://dresen.codes
Mostly a personal blog used to write about small stuff that I worked on. The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.0-next.0 and the blog entries are stored in a cloud [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com) database.

Blog entries are written in markdown using the [ngx-markdown](https://github.com/jfcere/ngx-markdown/) package with Code & LaTeX support via [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) and [katex](https://katex.org/).
